# DFIRArtifactMuseum
The goal of this repo is to archive artifacts from all versions of various OS's and categorizing them by type. This will help with artifact validation processes as well as increase access to artifacts that may no longer be readily available anymore. 

## Help Wanted!

In this Linux section, if you have samples of any of the logs (yes, I know they're plain text files), please consider contributing sanitized copies of those files. Anything that's potentially forensically interesting, we need samples of!
