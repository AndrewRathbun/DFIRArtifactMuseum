# Windows 8 Prefetch

![PrefetchWindows8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewRathbun/DFIRArtifactMuseum/main/Windows/Prefetch/Win8/RathbunVM/prefetch_win8.png)

Archive folder was created to store previous Prefetch artifacts due to the unknown version of `ntoskrnl.exe` for the VM that those artifacts were generated from. They can still be used for educational purposes, but the `RathbunVM.7z` file will contain the Prefetch files associated with the above `ntoskrnl.exe` version.
