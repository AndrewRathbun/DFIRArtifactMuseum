# DFIRArtifactMuseum
The goal of this repo is to archive artifacts from all versions of various OS's and categorizing them by type. This will help with artifact validation processes as well as increase access to artifacts that may no longer be readily available anymore. 

## PLACEHOLDER README, WORK IN PROGRESS, STAY TUNED!
