# DFIRArtifactMuseum
## Description
The DFIR Artifact Museum was created to provide a centralized location for examples of artifacts from various operating systems. 

## Purpose
To increase accessibility to sample artifacts without individual researchers having to duplicate efforts to generate data that frankly should be done once and then shared with the community so more time and energy can be spent on analysis rather than artifact generation. 

## Benefits
Hopefully, with more exposure to artifacts from various operating systems centralized in a single location, someone who never uses Linux might gain more familiarity with what Linux artifacts look like. Same with someone who only uses Linux and doesn't use Windows. 

Additionally, with more exposure to artifacts, hopefully those who enjoy creating tools will have sample data from which they can create a parser and share with the community. Having an artifact readily available as sample data takes one major hassle out of the way when it comes to having an idea for a parsing tool to actually creating it and sharing it.
