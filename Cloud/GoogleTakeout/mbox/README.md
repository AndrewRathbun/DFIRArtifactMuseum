## MBBox Files

A free tool to view MBOX files is [Windows MBBox Viewer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mbox-viewer/). 

### Converting MBox Files to Other Formats

[Aid4Mail](https://www.aid4mail.com/download-free-trial) provides a free trial download with a few limitations (not an issue to test data and research, but problematic when dealing with actual evidence). 

```
During trial mode, Aid4Mail makes these modifications to converted emails:
* Subject lines are truncated to 20 characters and the following text is added: [Created with trial version of Aid4Mail]
* The From email address is replaced with: trial-mode@aid4mail.com
* Attachments, and sometimes embedded contents, are removed from emails that exceed 1 MB (Aid4Mail Enterprise and Aid4Mail Investigator) or 10 MB (Aid4Mail Converter).
```
