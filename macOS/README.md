# DFIRArtifactMuseum

The goal of this repo is to archive artifacts from all versions of various OS's and categorizing them by type. This will help with artifact validation processes as well as increase access to artifacts that may no longer be readily available anymore. 

## macOS Artifacs

If you have any macOS artifacts laying around that you'd be willing to share, PLEASE let me know and we'll get them in here!
