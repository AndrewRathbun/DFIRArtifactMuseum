# Contributing to DFIRArtifactMuseum
This will be created in the very near future. Thank you for your patience! 

In the meantime, please gather as many artifacts as you can and store them in the following format when you do a PR:

`OS\ArtifactType\OSVersion\Artifact.db`

For instance:

`Windows\JumpLists\Win10\5f7b5f1e01b83767.automaticDestinations-ms`

## Adding Documentation

If you are contributing a new Artifact, please use the [ArtifactTemplate.md](https://github.com/AndrewRathbun/DFIRArtifactMuseum/blob/main/.github/ArtifactTemplates.md) document as the README in that artifact's folder.

If you are contributing to an Operating System, please consider updating the associated README, if it makes sense.

Thank you for any contribution you make!
